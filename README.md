# Midapta
Midapta is intended to reflect the beautiful material design philosophy and color scheme of Adapta.
In fact, Midapta is a spin off of the term _My Adapta_.
It was created using the Oomox theme generating application and then manually going into certain style definitions and tweaking them to my liking.
Oomox currently generates one style of cinnamon theme based on the Materia parameters you give it, but I wanted my cinnamon theme to have the same panel color as it does window menu color.
### Icons
This theme was designed with the [Flat-Remix](https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix) icon theme in mind.
### Cursor
Thes theme works very well with the Breeze cursor theme.
### Check Out
The [Ooomox app](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox) is just great if you can't seem to be satisfied with a theme other than your own!
