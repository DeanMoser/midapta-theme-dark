# Midapta
* Midapta is intended to reflect the beautiful material design philosophy and color scheme of Adapta.
In fact, Midapta is a spin off of the term _My Adapta_.
It was created using the Oomox theme generating application and then manually going into certain style definitions and tweaking them to my liking.
* Oomox currently generates one style of cinnamon theme based on the Materia parameters you give it, but I wanted my cinnamon theme to have the same panel color as it does window menu color.
### Icons
* This theme was designed with the [Flat-Remix](https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix) icon theme in mind.
### Cursor
* Thes theme works very well with the Breeze cursor theme.
### Check Out
* The [Ooomox app](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox) is just great if you can't seem to be satisfied with a theme other than your own!
